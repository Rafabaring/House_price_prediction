# House_price_prediction
This is a study on how to apply simply linear regression model on a housing dataset

For the last couple of weeks, I have been doing a Linear Regression course at Udemy. Its a pre-requisite for Deep Learning course.


In order to put my learnings up to the test, I choose the House Price Prediction Kaggle challenge to participate in.

WHAT TO RUN

You can find and download my work under Housing_price_prediction.ipynb. As there are a lot of charts and data visualization in this file, I highly recommend to run it with a Jupyter notebook installed in your computer (http://jupyter.org/)

WHAT YOU WILL FIND

My purpose in this study is not to derive to the linear model. I have done that during the on-line course and the model is "commented" in the source code. My purpose here is to manipulate a dataset and apply the model taught in the course to see it in action and upload my results to Kaggle

WHAT I EXPECT

Please, feel free to download, evaluate, analyze, comment and give me feedback on my work. I truly believe that people grow with constructive feedback. I'm very excited to hear what you have to say about my work.

Have fun
